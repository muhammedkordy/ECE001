<br>Operating system is the most important software that runs on a computer. It manages the computer's memory and processes, as well as all of its software and hardware. It also allows you to communicate with the computer without knowing how to speak the computer's language. Without an operating system, a computer is useless. It acts as an intermediary between the user of a computer and computer hardware. The purpose of an operating system is to provide an environment in which a user can execute programs in a convenient and efficient manner. An operating system is concerned with the allocation of resources and services, such as memory, processors, devices, and information. The operating system correspondingly includes programs to manage these resources, such as a traffic controller, a scheduler, memory management module, I/O programs, and a file system.<br/>

<br>**Functions :<br/>

<br>1) Process Management<br/>
<br>Operating System also Treats the Process Management means all the Processes those are given by the user or the Process those are System ‘s own Process are Handled by the Operating System . The Operating System will Create the Priorities foe the user and also Start or Stops the Execution of the Process and Also Makes the Child Process after dividing the Large Processes into the Small Processes.<br/>

<br>2) Memory Management<br/>
<br>Operating System also Manages the Memory of the Computer System means Provide the Memory to the Process and Also Deallocate the Memory from the Process. And also defines that if a Process gets completed then this will deallocate the Memory from the Processes.<br/>

<br>3) Extended Machine<br/>
<br>Operating System also behaves like an Extended Machine means Operating system also Provides us Sharing of Files between Multiple Users, also Provides Some Graphical Environments and also Provides Various Languages for Communications and also Provides Many Complex Operations like using Many Hardware’s and Software’s.<br/>

<br>4) Mastermind<br/>
<br>Operating System also performs Many Functions and for those Reasons we can say that Operating System is a Mastermind. It provides Booting without an Operating System and Provides Facility to increase the Logical Memory of the Computer System by using the Physical Memory of the Computer System and also provides various Types of Formats Like NTFS and FAT File Systems.<br/>

<br>**Types :<br/>

<br>1) Simple Batch Systems<br/>
<br>In this type of system, there is no direct interaction between user and the computer. The user has to submit a job (written on cards or tape) to a computer operator. Then computer operator places a batch of several jobs on an input device. Jobs are batched together by type of languages and requirement. Then a special program, the monitor, manages the execution of each program in the batch.
The monitor is always in the main memory and available for execution.<br/>

<br>2) Multiprogramming Batch Systems<br/>
<br>In this the operating system picks up and begins to execute one of the jobs from memory. Once this job needs an I/O operation operating system switches to another job (CPU and OS always busy). Jobs in the memory are always less than the number of jobs on disk(Job Pool). If several jobs are ready to run at the same time, then the system chooses which one to run through the process of CPU Scheduling. In Non-multiprogrammed system, there are moments when CPU sits idle and does not do any work.
In Multiprogramming system, CPU will never be idle and keeps on processing.<br/>

<br>3) Multiprocessor Systems<br/>
<br>A Multiprocessor system consists of several processors that share a common physical memory. Multiprocessor system provides higher computing power and speed. In multiprocessor system all processors operate under single operating system. Multiplicity of the processors and how they do act together are transparent to the others.<br/>

<br>4) Distributed Operating System<br/>
<br>The motivation behind developing distributed operating systems is the availability of powerful and inexpensive microprocessors and advances in communication technology. These advancements in technology have made it possible to design and develop distributed systems comprising of many computers that are inter connected by communication networks. The main benefit of distributed systems is its low price/performance ratio.<br/>
