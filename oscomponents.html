<br>1) File Management<br/>
<br>A file is a set of related information which is should define by its creator. It commonly represents programs, both source and object forms, and data. Data files can be numeric, alphabetic, or alphanumeric.<br/>

<br>2) Process Management<br/>
<br>The process management component is a procedure for managing the many processes that are running simultaneously on the operating system. Every software application program has one or more processes associated with them when they are running. For example, when you use a browser like Google Chrome, there is a process running for that browser program. The OS also has many processes running, which performing various functions. All these processes should be managed by process management, which keeps processes for running efficiently. It also uses memory allocated to them and shutting them down when needed.
The execution of a process must be sequential so, at least one instruction should be executed on behalf of the process.<br/>

<br>3) I/O Device Management<br/>
<br>One of the important use of an operating system that helps you to hide the variations of specific hardware devices from the user.

<br/>

<br>4) Network Management<br/>
<br>Network management is the process of administering and managing computer networks. It includes performance management, fault analysis, provisioning of networks, and maintaining the quality of service. A distributed system is a collection of computers/processors that never share their own memory or a clock. In this type of system, all the processors have their local Memory, and the processors communicate with each other using different communication lines, like fiber optics or telephone lines.
The computers in the network are connected through a communication network, which can be configured in a number of different ways. With the help of network management, the network can be fully or partially connected, which helps users to design routing and connection strategies that overcome connection and security issues.<br/>

<br>5) Main Memory management<br/>
<br>Main Memory is a large array of storage or bytes, which has an address. The memory management process is conducted by using a sequence of reads or writes of specific memory addresses. In order to execute a program , it should be mapped to absolute addresses and loaded inside the Memory. The selection of a memory management method depends on several factors.
However, it is mainly based on the hardware design of the system. Each algorithm requires corresponding hardware support. Main Memory offers fast storage that can be accessed directly by the CPU. It is costly and hence has a lower storage capacity. However, for a program to be executed, it must be in the main Memory.<br/>

<br>5) Secondary-Storage Management<br/>
<br>The most important task of a computer system is to execute programs. These programs, along with the data, helps you to access, which is in the main memory during execution. This Memory of the computer is very small to store all data and programs permanently. The computer system offers secondary storage to back up the main Memory. Today modern computers use hard drives/SSD as the primary storage of both programs and data. However, the secondary storage management also works with storage devices, like a USB flash drive, and CD/DVD drives.<br/>

<br>6) Security Management<br/>
<br>The various processes in an operating system need to be secured from each other's activities. For that purpose, various mechanisms can be used to ensure that those processes which want to operate files, memory CPU, and other hardware resources should have proper authorization from the operating system. For example, Memory addressing hardware helps you to confirm that a process can be executed within its own address space. The time ensures that no process has control of the CPU without renouncing it.
Lastly, no process is allowed to do its own I/O, to protect, which helps you to keep the integrity of the various peripheral devices.<br/>
